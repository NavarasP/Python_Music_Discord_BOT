## About

The Discord Music Bot is a Python-based bot that enables users to play music from YouTube in voice channels on Discord. The bot is built using the nextcord library, which is an API wrapper for Discord's API, and it utilizes various external libraries like pytube and youtube-search-python to interact with YouTube and play audio streams in voice channels.
## Features
- Joining Voice Channels: Users can use the @bot join command to make the bot join the voice channel they are currently in.

- Adding Songs to Queue: The bot allows users to add songs to a queue using the @bot add command. Users can provide a song name, search query, or playlist URL. The bot fetches the required information and adds the songs to the queue.

- Playing Songs: The @bot play command starts playing songs from the queue. The bot downloads the audio streams from YouTube using the pytube library and plays them in the voice channel using the nextcord library's audio features.

- Pausing and Resuming Playback: Users can pause playback using the @bot pause command and resume it using the @bot resume command.

- Skipping Songs: The @bot skip command allows users to skip the current song in the queue.

- Stopping Playback and Disconnecting: Users can stop the bot's playback and disconnect it from the voice channel using the @bot stop command.
## Requirements

Mention the prerequisites and dependencies required to run your bot. Include Python version, libraries, and any external tools.

## Installation

Explain the steps to set up your bot in a user's environment. This should include cloning the repository, installing dependencies (refer to `requirements.txt`), and any other configuration steps.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Use the Discord Music Bot

Follow these steps to set up and use the Discord Music Bot:

### 1. Create a Bot on Discord Developer Portal

- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on the "New Application" button.
- Give your application a name, then click "Create."

### 2. Add a Bot User

- In your application's dashboard, navigate to the "Bot" section on the left.
- Click the "Add Bot" button.
- Customize your bot's username and profile picture if desired.
- Under the "Token" section, click "Copy" to copy your bot's token. This token is crucial for your bot to log in.

### 3. Invite Your Bot to a Server

- In the "Bot" section, scroll down to the "Token Permissions" area.
- Choose the permissions your bot needs. At minimum, it will require "Read Messages" and "Connect" permissions.
- Copy the generated OAuth2 URL with the selected permissions.
- Open the URL in your browser, select the server where you want to add the bot, and follow the prompts to authorize it.

### 4. Run the Bot

- Download or clone the bot's source code to your local machine.
- Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal within your bot's directory.
- Replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` in the code with the token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.
- Run the bot's Python script (e.g., `python bot_script.py`) to start the bot.

### 5. Join a Voice Channel

- Open your Discord client and join a voice channel in a server where the bot is also present.
- If the bot's code includes a command to make the bot join the voice channel (e.g., `@bot join`), use that command to make the bot join.

### 6. Adding Songs

- Use the bot's command (e.g., `@bot add <search query>`) to add songs to the queue. You can use a song name, search query, or a YouTube URL.

### 7. Playing Songs

- To start playing songs from the queue, use the `@play` command.

### 8. Controlling Playback

- Use the provided commands like `@pause`, `@resume`, `@skip`, and `@stop` to control the playback.

Remember to keep each bot token private and not share it with anyone. If your bot is in a public GitHub repository, use environment variables or a configuration file to store sensitive information securely.

By following these steps, you can create a functional Discord music bot, invite it to your server, and enjoy playing music in voice channels.
